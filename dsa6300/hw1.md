## The decision context and the specific decision that was made.

Moving to USA from Canada for work and new life I had to make a choice on where to live: Windsor or Detroit, rent or buy in either localities. I need to be able to provide the space for me and a kid. The was a posibility of a kid living with me and attending local school.
The decision was made to rent an adequte space downtown Detroit, walking distance from the office, that includes all the appliencies instead of buying or renting far enough in Detroit or Windsor to need a car to commute to work.

## Major subsequent decisions, if any, influenced by this decision.
The decision was made not to have car/insurence, use public transport, bike and rideshare as the means of transportation, bike or walk to grocery stores or markets, cook meals for myself and kids, walk home to have lunch, use the tunnel bus to travel to Windsor to catch a train to Toronto.

## The primary objective and any secondary objectives that drove the decision.
Have a place to live, work and spend time with kids, save the time not comuting long ways on public transit, save sanity by not owning the car and driving to/from work, save money by not paying car insurence in Detroit, get healthier by using bike and feet to procure groceries from places like Eastern Market and Honey Bee.

## The factors that made it a hard decision
The impact was quility of life that is important given the volatility of the sitution for the all parties involved. It is the start of the "second immigration".
The resources spent had a limit of $1'500/month.

## The risks associated with the decision.
The risk of buyng of the house having poor knowledge of Detroit neiborhoods and transportatio system could jeopardize commute to work, recreation time, safety of the car/property in the case of buyng in the areas where public transportation is not an option.
The year long commitment to the lease in case of rent restricts the ability to move if life situation changes.

## Time pressures, if any.
Two weeks to research and find the space, get the credit check done, do all the paper work, being in Toronto during the first half and in the hotel the other half. 

## If the decision was revisited, explain the circumstances.
The desision was reviseted in two years with the idea of buy a space, possibly a house, start commuting, have a car but situation was not in favour of changing the current setup.

## Constraints surrounding the selection of viable alternatives.
No credit history in USA did not allow to obtain mortgage that may allowed to have a house owned. The need to travel frequently to Toronto required the proximity to reliable rail transport in Windsor. Personal dislike to commuting to work by car.

## Globalizationâ€™s potential impact or role in the decision, if any.

The space has a good option to work remotely: a 1Gb/sec Up/Down internet connection. This satisfies all needs for Video conferensing, IP telephony and even hosting for POCs of the projects. The proximity to DWT airport and a 4 hours train ride to YTZ/YYZ airports makes it easier to travel to remote office locations of clients and/or remote employers.

## What concerns would you have with the quality of the process used to make the decision?
The rent prices were relativly high with not many options: it was easy to commit to something not adequate using mostly online images and plans. 
The locals frastration about living downtown Detroit was not well understood giving some degree of uncetanty that choice is adequate and safe.

An improved hybrid alternative would be to buy a flat/apartmen/loft downtown Detroit: center, alond Woodward, Eastern Market areas. It is now actually next step although prices gone up already.
