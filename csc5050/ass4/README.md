## Q3
The popular social network Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg and his classmates at Harvard University in 2004. At the time, he was a sophomore studying computer science.
Design and implement an application that maintains the data for a simple social network.

Your application should allow a user to join the network, leave the network, create a profile, modify the profile, search for other profiles, and add friends. (6 points)
