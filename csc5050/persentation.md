Hi, Hayder!
I appreciate that you have invited the guest speakers to talk about the profession to students. It is a very important part of the professional training process. I would like to have an opportunity to speak in front of the class about my experience as a Software Eng as well as highlight what we do at QL. The high-level plan is as follows:

* My journey as Software Eng
* Notable languages and they features
* Right tool for the right job: what languages we use, where we use them
* Opportunities/internships with QL
